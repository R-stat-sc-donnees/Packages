\title{health (data)}

\description{
In 1989-1990 the Valencian Institute of Public Health (IVESP) conducted a survey to better know the attitudes and opinions related to health for the non-expert population. The first question included in the questionnaire "What does health mean to you?" required free and spontaneous answers. A priori, the variables Age group (under 21, 21-35, 36-50 and over 50), Health condition (poor, fair, good and very good health) and Gender were considered as possibly conditioning the respondents' viewpoint on health.
